CS452/EE465 Computer Graphics Spring 2015
Lab #3

due: Monday, 3/2/15 at midnight

Write a WebGL application that will display, light, and rotate a 3D shape.

Create an interesting 3D object (other than a cube or a sphere). Your object should be in local coordinates, 
so you will need a ModelView matrix to transform into model then eye coordinates. It should be a color other 
than gray.

Add a light, and use the modified Phong lighting model to color your object.

The arrow keys will rotate the object as follows: left arrow - rotate counterclockwise about the Y axis; 
right arrow - rotate clockwise about the Y axis; up arrow - rotate counterclockwise about the X axis;
down arrow - rotate clockwise about the X axis.

Use a perspective projection matrix.

Requirements:
1. vertex coordinates are not in the default range - a (non identity) Model-View matrix is required.

2. use webgl-utils.js, initShaders.js and MV.js from Angel // 

3. three files are required in the solution: lab3.html, lab3.js and lab3.README.txt. The lab3.README.txt file
will contain your name and date along with a brief description of your solution. Note, however, that all
files should contain a comment including your name and date. // 

4. add a light, and use the modified Phong lighting model. It's your choice about whether to compute
the lighting in the vertex shader or the fragment shader //

5. interact with your object with the arrow keys as described above. // 

6. use a perspective projection matrix (you determine the properties) //
