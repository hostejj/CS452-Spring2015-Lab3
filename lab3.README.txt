Description: Lab3

I'll break my solution down into parts that address the corresponding problems giving in the lab.txt file.

1 (Vertex coordinates not default)
I used a coordinate system from -10 to +10 and scaled it by scaling the model view matrix.

2 (Use angel's utilities)
I used angel's utilities for his vec and mat functions as well as rotation and view projection.

3 (Files)
The three files all have a comment.

4 (Phong Lighting)
I used a modified Phong lighting model based on some of the examples done by angel. I choose to
compute the lighting inside the vertex-shader instead of the fragment shader.

5 (Interaction) 
I set up the interaction as specified by setting up a small state machine in the JavaScript that causes
rotation to spin directionally based on the state. Additionally I created a pause state to freeze the
object with the "P" key on the keyboard.

6 (Projection Matrix)
I used angel's "ortho" utility to create the projection matrix for my solution.
